# README 
This is Esperanza Uribe & Lucas Latuz work
We created an admin user in the seeds file for debugging purposes, you can use it if
you want, the credentials are 
email: fjborie@miuandes.cl 	password: lalala for the admin user 
email: mrgarcia@miuandes.cl 	password: 123456 for the non admin user
the user with the id 1 has every project


Bugs(?):
Projects still ask for current amount and approved when created
Can't edit categories (but can create and delete them)
