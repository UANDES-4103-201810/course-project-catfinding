# README 
#This is Esperanza Uribe & Lucas Latuz work
#Please run this on the navigator and NOT in postman like we did for a solid 5 hours
#We strongly recommend this ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s4slliAtQU ) during the correction
#We think that categories should only be managed by owners, so we simply eliminated the edit/delete options, is intended
#There's no admins for now so no one can be admin. (even if you try)
#Salutations
